<h2>Loop Methods</h2>

<p>In javascript there are several loop methods available in javascript that makes it possible to quickly iterate over arrays.</p>

<p><h5>forloop</h5>- which we used in java from 1 semester. It goes through all elements in that array.</p>
<div class="code-container">
        <code>
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.log(array[i]);}           
        </code>
</div>
<p><h5>foreach</h5>- iterate over each item and can apply a function to each of them</p>
<div class="code-container">
        <code>
array.forEach(item => {
    console.log(item);
});      
        </code>
</div>
<p><h5> map() </h5>- iterate over an array and creates a new array by executing the function between the brackets for each element of the original array.</p>
<p><em>spreadoperator</em> is here used to create a new object with all the properties of the original array. This is to ensure that the original array remains unchanged. 
    If i added the owner property and didnt use the spreadoperator, it would change the original array as well and we would have unintended sideeffects.(effects that weren't intended)</p>
<div class="code-container">
    <pre>
        <code>
<em>//iterate though spaceships array and for each element in that array it
    sets the propery "owner" to be "china". Instead of return just the new array.
    We use a spreadoperator to we avoid mutuble arraylist.
</em>
const spaceshipWithOwners = spaceships.map((spaceship) =>{
    spaceship.owner = "china"
    return {...spaceship, owner: "china"};
});         
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<p><h5>filter()</h5>- is used to create a new array with all elements from that array that has passed through a specific test. 
    Basicly we filter the array by giving it a condition to filter from.</p>
<div class="code-container">
    <pre>
        <code>
<em>Basicly it makes a new array with all the elements that has the property priceless equal to true</em>
const newSpaceshipArray = spaceships.filter(spaceship => spaceship.isPriceless === true)
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<p><h5>reduce()</h5>- is used to reduce an array to a single value by executing a function for each element in that array. It takes two params; a callbackfunction and an initial value, where the accumulation should start.</p>
<p>It calls the callbackfunction on every element and returns acumulated result of that.</p>
<div class="code-container">
    <pre>
        <code>
<em>//reduce() counts the totalprice of the spaceships</em>
<em>//accumulator holds the running value of </em>
const totalPrice = spaceships.reduce((accumulator, spaceship) =>{
    return accumulator + spaceship.price;
}, 0)
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<p><h5>find()</h5> - returns the value of the first element where the condition is met (always a single value) or undefined. </p>
<div class="code-container">
        <code>
<em>//It finds the spaceship that has the property name called cam.</em>
const specificSpaceship = spaceships.find(spaceship => spaceship.name === cam)
        </code>
</div>
