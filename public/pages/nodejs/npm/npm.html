        <h5>Difference between Maven and NPM</h5>
        <p>Both Maven and NPM are package managers. A package manager is a software tool which is used to manage the installation, updating and removal of software packages or modules. They both do the same, but in different ways. Maven manages packages for java developement and uses a more complex configuation system based om XML files including POM.XL which includes dependencies and information about the project.</p>

</div>
<p>Npm only uses one configuration file which is called package.json. When ever a package is installed by using npm , the package and its dependencies are downloaded and installed into node_modules</p>

    <h3>How to install</h3>
        <div id="inner-second-container">
            <h5>One way to install dependencies</h5>
            <p>1. Make a file in your project called package.json</p>
            <p>2. In the package.json file. You can manually write the dependencies to be installed eks.:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        {
                        "dependencies": "life-cycles"
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>
            <p>by writing this in the terminal it installs all the dependencies in package.json: </p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        npm install
                    </code>
                </div>
            <h5>Another way to do it is:</h5>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        npm install life-cycles
                    </code>
                </div>
            <p>With that command It automaticly makes the package.json file and it installs the packages and its dependencies in node_modules</p>
            <p>We can always uninstall packages in the terminal by writing this</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        npm uninstall life-cycles
                    </code>
                </div>
        </div>

    </div>
