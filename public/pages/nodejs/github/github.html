Forexsample node_modules that contains a lot of dependencies and can be large in size. Its good practice to choose gitignore node since it keeps the repository clean and free of unnecessary files which makes it easier to collaborate with others, makes it faster to download and clone since its smaller. Another reason could be to protect sensitive data like forexsample .env file which typically contains enviromental variables. These variables can be passwords and other confidential data which is crucial for the applilkation to work. Protecting confidential data is critical in terms of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability </p>

    <p>Copy the path to the repository and clone the repositpory in the terminal in VS code, like this: </p>
    <div class="code-container"><code>git clone thenPastedinTheCopiedRepoFromGithub</code></div>
    <p>Now you have copied the repository to you computer and can now make a project</p>
    <p>...After making new files(also called modules) to the project</p>
    <p> Open terminal in VS code and "cd" (change directory) to the folder/repository you want add to github</p>
    <p>Type this:</p>
    <p>-A means that you add all the files in the folder</p>
    <div class="code-container"><code>git add -A</code></div>
    <div class="code-container"><code>git commit -m "You give it a message suitable for the commit</code></div>
    <p>And you push it to github</p>
    <div class="code-container"><code>git push</code></div>
    <p>Command to make a branch: </p>
    <div class="code-container"><code>git branch >writethenameofthebranch></code></div>
