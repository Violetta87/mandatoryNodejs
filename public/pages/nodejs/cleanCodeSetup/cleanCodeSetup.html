<h2>Clean code</h2>

<p>To make code more maintable, readable and easier to make a collaboration on. Its very important to write clean code and follow coding conventions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be consistent in naming variables that makes sense. Use camelcase for functions and variable in the second word like <em> testForThis() </em>, and of course use camelCase if its a class name. </li>
    <li>Keep functions focused which makes it easier to reuse.</li>
    <li>Very important to make comments.</li>
    <li>Do not use globalvariables like ex.<em> "var" </em> - which makes it easier to NOT have unexpected behaviour in the code.</li>
    <li>Handle errors - so the application doesn't crash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tools to make it easier to identify and fix issues is to use ESLint which is an open-source utility for javascript and is easy to install in VS code.</p>
<p>Another way to prevent errors and encourage better coding standards is to <em>"use strict"</em> mode. Which is written in the top of the javascript file. This ensure that fx. variable has to be declared or else it will give an error. </p>

<h3>Setup to ensure a good structure</h3>
<div id="first-container">
    <p>To enable a good and clean code structure in a nodejs application and overall. Its good practice to setup a good folder-structure. This makes it easier for yourself but also for other people to maintain the code, test, fix bugs, refactor the code etc.</p>
    <div id="first-inner-container">
        <p>An important and common Nodejs folder-structure is keeping the serverside and clientside seperat from eachother. Which means public folder contains all clientside material; such as the html-pages, css, components used to build the navbar and footer, images and so on. Utils can be a folder to all serversite logic such as a template engine.</p>
