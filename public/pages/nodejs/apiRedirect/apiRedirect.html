<h3>How to make a restAPI</h3>
<p>API (Application programming interface) is a set of rules and protocols, which allows softwareapplications to communicate with eachother. Rest APIs refers to APIs being stateless. Which basicly means that no information is being stored outside the URL. Rest API is a way to send and receive data, and from there manipulate data like create, reading, updating and deleting data(since its build on top of the http protocol). It can be send in different formats; such as JSON or XML.</p>
<p>An exsample could be; that facebook among others has released an API which makes it possible for developers to have access to data from facebook and from there they can build an application with the data.</p>
<br>
<p>An exsample of a restAPI design:</p>
<div class="code-container">
    <pre>
        <code>
<em>//Make notice endpoint always is in plural(good practice)</em>
GET    /persons
GET    /persons/:id
POST   /persons
UPDATE /persons/:id
Delete /persons/:id
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<br><br>
<p>An exsample of a restAPI</p>
<div class="code-container">
    <pre>
        <code>
<em>//In the URL path we indicate its an API and what version (if needed)</em>
<em>//eks. We can make a method to ex. fetch data in another module, 
    import the module/method to app.js and call that method, 
    to show the data in the response - Then we made an restAPI</em>
app.get("/api/v1/persons", (req,res) =>{
    res.send({data: getPersons()})
})
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>

<h3>Different ways of sending response to clientside</h3>
<p>When sending a response to the clientside. Theres different ways of sending the response:</p>
<div class="response-container">
    <h5>JSON</h5>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
            <code>
    <em>// '{}' indicated that we are sending a json response. </em>
    app.get("/persons", (req,res) => {
        res.send({message: "This is a way to send json"})
    })
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="response-container">
    <h5>String</h5>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
            <code>
<em>Will be shown as plain text in the browser</em>
app.get("/persons", (req, res) => {
    res.send("a way to send a string")
})
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="response-container">
    <h5>HTML - CommonJS</h5>
    <p> <em>__dirname</em> is a string that representate the absolute path of the directory of the project and must be included when sending a htmlpage as a response. __dirname is a feature that is specific to the Nodejs runtime enviroment which implement the CommonJS modulesystem by default. This means its not possible to use it if the module system is changed to ECMA script.</p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
            <code>
<em>//A way send an html as response to client.</em>
app.get("/persons", (req,res) =>{
    res.sendFile(_dirname + "/public/frontpage/frontpage.html")
})
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

</div>
<br><br>
<div class="response-container">
    <h5>HTML - ECMAscript</h5>
    <p>When changing the modulesystem to ECMA script <em>__dirname</em> cant be used to set the absolute path. Therefor a way to resolve this would be to import <em>path</em> which is a built in module. <em>Path</em> contains methods for working with files and paths. Therefor we use <em>Path.resolve()</em>.</p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
            <code>
<em>//This method resolves the relative path into an absolute path. Which is why "/" is not added infront of public folder.</em>
import path from "path"

app.get("/persons", (req,res) =>{
    res.sendFile(path.resolve("public/frontpage/frontpage.html"))
})
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="line"></div>

<h3>Proxy Server</h3>
<p>A proxy server is a system or a router that acts like a gateway between the client and the server. When a user sends a request to access a webpage the request is sent to the proxy-server which forward the request to the targeted webpage.</p>
<p>This is especially good security wise cause the proxy-server hides the IP adress of the webpage.This is a way to be anomenous. An exsample of how a proxy-server works using Nodejs and express is:</p>
<div class="code-container">
    <pre>
        <code>
<em>We fetch the url and then convert the response to text - then send that result to the clientside.</em>
<em>response.text() means that the response can be send as a plain string in the response.</em>
app.get("/proxy", (req,res) => {
    fetch('https://google.com').then(response => response.text()).then(result => res.send(result))
})
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>


<div class="line"></div>

<h3>Redirect - Client-side vs. Server-side</h3>

<p>Theres different ways of redirecting in Nodejs/javascript in terms of SSR and CSR.</p>
<div class="code-container">
    <pre>
        <code>
<em>//redirecting in SSR by using Express framework:</em>
<em>//If the user and password is correct. Then res.redirect to home page</em>
app.post('/login', (req,res) => {
    const { user, password } = req.body;
    if(correctUser.user === user && correctUser.password === password){
        res.redirect("/");
    }else{
        res.send("invalid user or password");
    }

})
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<br>
<div class="code-container">
    <pre>
        <code>
<em>//We can use window.location in CSR to redirect to another location. Ex:</em>
<em>//window.location is a globalobject and href is a property - together it redirects to "/"</em>
const button= document.getElementById("button").addEventListener('click', () =>{
    window.location.href("/")
})
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>

<p>Redirecting in both CSR and SSR can make sense depending on the reason. In CSR it would make sense if the redirecting is happening cause of a user interaction. In SSR it would make sense if the redirection should happen already before loading the application(SSR processing), or if there is some logic happening on SSR before the redirection, like ex. with a login or pages being routed.</p>
