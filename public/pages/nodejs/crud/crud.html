<h2>Crud - Create, Read, Update, Delete</h2>

<p>CRUD is refered to as four basic functions thats should be implemented in a application with a database.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<div id="crud-container">
    <div class="inner-text-container">
        <h5>Create</h5>
        <p><em> app.post() </em> is a method provided by express framework for defining a route that handles POST requests on a specific URL Path. <em>app</em> refers to the instance of the Express.js server and <em>get()</em> is a method that takes to params; a string representation of the URL path and a callback function that will be executed when a POST request is made for that URL path. It refers to the "C" in CRUD.</p>
        <div class="code-container">
            <pre>
                <code>
<em>//routerhandler for HTTP POST request on "/test endpoint</em>
<em>//execute callback function when POST is made to that endpoint</em>
<em>//Callback f: - retrieves the data send in the POST request body, 
    by req.body object and assigned to a variable</em>
<em>//data is added to an array of persons</em>
<em>//It sends a JSON response to the client with the new created person</em>
app.post("/test", (req,res) => {
    const personTobeCreated = req.body
    persons.push(personToBeCreated)
    res.send({data: personTobeCreated})
})
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="line"></div>
    <div class="inner-text-container">
        <h5>Read</h5>
        <p><em> app.get() </em> is a routehandler for handling HTTP GET requests to a specific URL path. It refers to the "R" in CRUD.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
            <code>
<em>//When ever a GET method is called on URL endpoin "/users" 
    its will execute the callback function, send a response back 
    the client which is users</em>
<em>//'{}' indicates that the response is send in json</em>
<em>users is a javascript object but will automaticly be parsed to json. 
    Since its part of HTTP protocol and default behaviour in express.</em>

app.get("/users", (req,res) =>{
    res.send({data: users})
})
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="line"></div>

    <div class="inner-text-container">
        <h5>Update</h5>
        <p><em> app.patch</em> is a routehandler for handling HTTP PATCH requests to a specific URL path. It refers to the "U" in CRUD. Theres two difference ways of updating data; "PATCH" and "PUT". HTTP method <em>"PUT"</em>; The entire data is being replaced with the new updated data. With <em>"PATCH"</em> It only changes the part that is set to be updated. Which is useful in terms of reducing the amount of data sent to the server over the network. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
            <code>
<em>//when a patch request is send to this route with a specific id. It executes the callbackfunction. </em>
<em>//findIndex - finds the index of the object with same id as req.params.id which is set in the URL path</em>
<em>//If statement checks if the found person was found in the persons array.</em>
<em>//If the person is found we use a spreadoperator to update the person. Basicly it creates a new person 
    that combines the properties of the foundperson
    with properties of the req.body into the personToBeUpdated and then sets the id to be the same as the foundperson. 
    It ensure it has the same id.
     - which kinda makes it the same object</em>
<em>Then persons array is then updated and we send the updatedperson to the client.</em>
app.patch("/persons/:id", (req,res) =>{
    const foundIndex = persons.findIndex((person) => person.id === Number(req.params.id))
    if(foundIndex === -1) {
        res.status(404).send({message: `No person found with id: ${foundperson}`})
    }else{
        const foundPerson = persons[foundIndex];
        const personToBeUpDated = {...foundPerson, ...req.body , id: foundPerson.id};
        persons[foundIndex] = personToBeUpdated
        res.send({ data: personToBeUpdated})
    }
})
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="line"></div>

    <div class="inner-text-container">
        <h5>Delete</h5>
        <p><em>app.delete() </em> is a routehandler for handling HTTP DELETE requests to a URL PATH. It refers to the "D" in CRUD. It handles deleting a person from a collection. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
            <code>
<em>//The Id in the URL is accessed with the req.params.id property.</em>
<em>Find index of a person matching the req.params.id</em>
<em>if statement; basicly if findIndex returns a non negative value, it means the person was found.</em>
<em>"splice()" removes the person from the array and returns the deleted person the client.</em>
app.delete("/persons/:id", (req, res) => {
const id = req.params.id
const foundIndex = persons.findIndex(person => person.id === Number(id));
    if(foundIndex === -1){
    res.status(404).send({data : foundIndex, message: `No person found with id: ${req.params.id} `})
        }else{
            const deletedPerson = birds.splice(foundIndex, 1);
            res.send({data: deletedBird});
        }
})
            </code>

    <p>A callbackfunction is a function passed in as a argument to another function. and is invoked by calling that function. Like with all four exsamples above.</p>

<div id="sendData-container">
    <h3>There are several ways to send data to the server from client-side:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><em>QueryString: </em> is a part of a URL that contains additional information in form a key-value pair. It follows <em> "?" </em> and contains params seperated by <em> "&" </em> An Exsample:<p>http://wwww.exsample.com/persons?name=cam&age=35</p></li>
        <li><em>req.params: </em> is an object that contains all route params extracted from the URL path. Its defined by using <em>" : "</em> and then ex. :id - value is extracted from the URL path and can be accessed through <em> req.params.id </em>.</li>
        <li><em>req.body: </em> is an object that contains the data send in the body of an HTTP request. It can be send in different formats but since the content-Type header is not set. Express will parse the request as JSON by default by using the middleware function <em> "body-parser()" </em>.</li>
    </ul>
