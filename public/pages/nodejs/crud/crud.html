<h2>Crud - Create, Read, Update, Delete</h2>

<p>CRUD is refered to as four basic functions thats should be implemented in a application with a database.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<div class="crud-container">
    <div .="first-inner-container">
        <h5>Create</h5>
        <p><em>app.post()</em> is a method provided by express framework for defining a route that handles POST requests on a specific URL Path. <em>app</em> refers to the instance of the Express.js server and <em>get()</em> is a method that takes to params; a string representation of the URL path and a callback function that will be executed when a POST request is made for that URL path. It refers to the "C" in CRUD.</p>
        <div class="code-container">
            <pre>
                <code>
<em>//routerhandler for HTTP POST request on "/test endpoint</em>
<em>//execute callback function when POST is made to that endpoint</em>
<em>//Callback f: - retrieves the data send in the POST request body, 
    by req.body object and assigned to a variable</em>
<em>//data is added to an array of persons</em>
<em>//It sends a JSON response to the client with the new created person</em>
app.post("/test", (req,res) => {
    const personTobeCreated = req.body
    persons.push(personToBeCreated)
    res.send({data: personTobeCreated})
})
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="line"></div>
    <div id="second-inner-container">
        <h5>Read</h5>
        <p><em>app.get()</em>is a routehandler for handling HTTP GET requests to a specific URL path. It refers to the "R" in CRUD.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
            <code>
<em>//When ever a GET method is called on URL endpoin "/users" 
    its will execute the callback function, send a response back 
    the client which is users</em>
<em>//'{}' indicates that the response is send in json</em>
<em>users is a javascript object but will automaticly be parsed to json. 
    Since its part of HTTP protocol and default behaviour in express.</em>

app.get("/users", (req,res) =>{
    res.send({data: users})
})
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="crud-container">
    <div class="first-inner-container"></div>
    <div class="first-inner-container"></div>
</div>

<p>A callbackfunction is a function passed in as a argument to another function. and is invoked by calling that function. Like with all four exsamples above.</p>
