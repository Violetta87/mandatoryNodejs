<h2>Introduction to Nodejs</h2>
    <p>Nodejs is an open source, cross-platform. server-side runtime enviroment buildt on Chrome's V8 engine. Basicly what it does is that it enables you to run javascript code on the server, instead of just in the browser. Nodejs makes it possible to make a fullstack application, backend and frontend in the same language; javascript.</p>
    <p>It runs on the serversite and provides an eventdriven and a non-blocking I/O model(input/out). This means that instead of waiting for input and output operations to complete and before moving to the next operation, Nodejs uses an event loop to process multiple I/O operations asynchronously. This makes it possible for Nodejs to handle a large number of I/O operations a the same time without blocking the execution of the applikation. Nodejs is therefor a suitable tool for making scalable and high performance fullstack applikations.</p>

    <p>I/O model determines how input from clients(http requests, websocket messages) is being processed. I/O Model is important for serverside and clientside implementation.</p>

<h3>How to install and get started</h3>
<p>Steps: </p>

<p>2. Type in gitbash to vertify the installation of node, this display the last version of Nodejs installed</p>
<div class="code-container"><code> node -v </code></div>
<p>To get started make a folder and "cd" your way into the folder and type.</p>
<div class="code-container"><code> . code </code></div>
<p>Which automaticly opens a project in VS code with the folder you just created</p>
