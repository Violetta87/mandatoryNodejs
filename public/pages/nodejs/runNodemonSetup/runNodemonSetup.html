<h2>How to run nodejs Projects?</h2>

<div id="setup-container">
    <div class="text-container">
       <p>The way we run our nodejs application is by running the main module; app.js which is typically our application entry point(best practices). But its possible to run any of the modules in the nodejs project. </p>
       <p> Make notes that its important to "cd" into the project you want to run. When you are in the given directory. Run this command in the terminal: (could be either in VS terminal or any other terminal in the computer.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="code-container">
            <code>
node app.js
            </code>
    </div>

    <div class="text-container">
        <p>But the command above means that you have to start the server everytime you make changes. By installing nodemon you only have to start the server one time and it automaticly starts it when ever changes has been made.</p>
        <h4>The installation of Nodemon:</h4>
        <p>1. Use Node package manager og and type:</p>
        <div class="code-container">
                <code>
<em>//-g stands for globally on the machine.(installed not just in the project)</em>
npm install -g nodemon
                </code>
        </div>
        <p>Once we have installed nodemon. We just need to start the server one time in the terminal, and it updates automaticly.</p>
        <div class="code-container">
            <code>
<em>//this have to be typed to start the nodemon in my computer due to 
    my computers operating system - but in other pc just nodemon should work. 
</em>
nodemon.cmd app.js
            </code>
        </div>
        <p>However nodemon monitors the serverside and does not monitor if changes are made in the frontend. We can resolve this problem by adding a "nodemon.json" file containing this:</p>
        <div class="code-container"> 
                <code>
<em>//The property "ext" stands for extention with the
    values: html, css, js - which makes nodemon 
    monitor those files for changes too.
</em>
{
    "ext": "html, js, css"
}
                </code>
        </div>
    </div>
